This is CODEBOOK for dataset2.

The data frame, dataset2 , is cleaned up from UCI HAR Dataset, which conduct from an experiment. Following is the description of the experiment.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 


###The variable of dataset2 are:

subject------ number of these 30 experiment volunteers
label-------- the label of activity 
tGravityAcc-mean()-X
42,tGravityAcc-mean()-Y
43, ...... --------------------------- all the features
